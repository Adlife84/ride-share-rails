Hi <%= @driver.first_name %>,

Thank you for volunteering with <%= @org.name %> ride sharing.
The following rides have been requested but don't have drivers yet.
Would you be willing to sign up for one of these rides?

<% @rides.each do |ride| %>
Pick up time: <%= ride.pick_up_time.strftime("%A, %B %d, %l:%M %p") %>
Pick up location: <%= ride.start_location.full_address %>
Destination location: <%= ride.end_location.full_address %>

<% end %>
