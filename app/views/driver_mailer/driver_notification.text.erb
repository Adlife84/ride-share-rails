Hi <%= @driver.first_name %>,

Thank you for volunteering with <%= @org.name %> ride sharing.

<% if @tomorrow_rides.any? %>
Tomorrow you are scheduled to give the following rides:

<% @tomorrow_rides.each do |ride| %>
Rider: <%= "#{ride.rider.full_name} phone: #{ride.rider.phone}" %>
Pick up time: <%= ride.pick_up_time.strftime("%A, %B %d, %l:%M %p") %>
Pick up location: <%= ride.start_location.full_address %>
Destination location: <%= ride.end_location.full_address %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
<% if @week_rides.any? %>
During the next week you are scheduled to give the following rides:

<% @week_rides.each do |ride| %>
Rider: <%= "#{ride.rider.full_name} phone: #{ride.rider.phone}" %>
Pick up time: <%= ride.pick_up_time.strftime("%A, %B %d, %l:%M %p") %>
Pick up location: <%= ride.start_location.full_address %>
Destination location: <%= ride.end_location.full_address %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
<% if @avail_rides.any? %>
The following rides have been requested but don't have drivers yet.  Would you
be willing to sign up for one of these rides?

<% @avail_rides.each do |ride| %>
Pick up time: <%= ride.pick_up_time.strftime("%A, %B %d, %l:%M %p") %>
Pick up location: <%= ride.start_location.full_address %>
Destination location: <%= ride.end_location.full_address %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
